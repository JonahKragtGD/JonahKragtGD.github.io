                <h2>Confluence Gold Ale</h2>
                <p>This beer was easy drinking with a lot going on, inoffensive, but flavorful enough to entice anyone on the beer drinking spectrum.</p>

                <p>Firetrucker Brewery is located in Ankeny IA, it's one of my favorites and their can design is incredible. Their tagline is "Beer is art" and it's easy to see why with this Brigade Ale I am drinking here.</p>

                <p>Jethros is a local Iowa BBQ joint, thet have arguably the best happy hour deals in the area, I am able to get this bad boy for only $7.50. This time I went with DSM IPA, my favorite beer from Confluence Brewing.</p>

                <p>A buddy of mine went on a trip to the Hot Springs area of Arkansas and picked me up this bad boy. It was delicious and I loved the branding, friends like this 10/10 beer like this? Check the score.</p>

                <h2>Goose Island Wild Herd</h2>
                <p>Buffalo Wild Wings or as I and almost every other jabroni likes to call it B dubs, has a special beer brewed by Goose Island in Chicago, IL. It's pretty solid stuff, just a regular Kolsch but the real thing that makes this beer cool is the price tag, at $4 (used to be $3) it's great to watch a game and have one or seven. Knowing that you can still afford to actually order food when you go out.</p>

                <h2>Voodoo Ranger IPA</h2>
                <p>Voodoo Ranger is a great beer, my problem is I forget how high of an ABV it has and always end up feeling it after 2 or 3, great beer, great flavor, and great value. One of my personal favorite non local craft beers.</p>

                <h2>Iowa State Hazy IPA</h2>
                <p>ISU Hazy IPA is a great beer and 1 of 4 officially liscened beers sporting ISU colors or signage, it's a Hazy IPA from Backpocket, which makes great beers all around. I love the can design and the monochromatic scheme.</p>

                <h2>Space Camper Cosmic IPA</h2>
                <p>I like reviewing the non local non small craft beers because I feel stuff like this is a great gateway into your own local beer scene as you can usually get this stuff anywhere and it is still quality stuff. The Space Camper from Boulevard in ole KC MO is no different great flavor, good finish and a nice kick to boot.</p>

                <h2>Henry's Hard Soda Orange</h2>
                <p>Believe it or not there was a time when I didn't really like beer, when I wanted something to drink this is what I would go for, it's a great way to change things up, but it can also give you gut rot if you drink too many. Overall great malt beverages.</p>

                <h2>Kilkenny (Nitro)</h2>
                <p>This beer was a red ale made by Guinness according to the menu at Dublin Bay in Ames. This beer was delicious, it wasn't too heavy, it wasn't too bitter, and it didn't make me feel bogged down. My only gripe is that there wasn't much flavor with it, but it was a good sipping beer.</p>

                <p>Shiner Bock is a Texas beer. They say everything is bigger in Texas. Looks like a pint to me.</p>

                <h2>Twisted Vine Raspberry Night Shift</h2>
                <p>Raspberry Night Shift was fantastic. Twisted Vine is one of my favorite breweries in the state. And this very well may be one of my favorite beers from said brewery. I had this at the Ames Jethros. One of the first times I've seen TVBs beers out in the wild. A welcome surprise for sure.</p>

                <h2>All Day IPA</h2>
                <p>All Day IPA is a good beer. Not my favorite IPA ever but I am happy to see it in most gas stations and grocery stores throughout the state of Iowa. It's a solid choice that is fairly priced, and easy to drink. It's a staple to find in coolers everywhere during a summer party and I will definitely be stocking up for my next cookout.</p>

                <p>The GOAT from 2007 is back this year, as such I felt it important to include in this website despite it not being beer. It's amazing, and tastes just as good as it did when I had it as a kid.</p>

                <h2>Mtn Dew Game Fuel Diablo IV</h2>
                <p>Much like the original halo game fuel from 2007 game fuel always launches in pairs, the first one is always the citrus cherry, and the second one is usually a different flavor, back in 2007 it was Halo 3 and World of Warcraft. This time around the other flavor is Diablo IV Mystic Punch. It's a tropical punch flavor, if you like that, you'll like it, if not you wont. Works great as a mixer.</p>
