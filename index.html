                <p>This beer was easy drinking with a lot going on, inoffensive, but flavorful enough to entice anyone on the beer drinking spectrum.</p>

                <p>Buffalo Wild Wings or as I and almost every other jabroni likes to call it B dubs, has a special beer brewed by Goose Island in Chicago, IL. It's pretty solid stuff, just a regular Kolsch but the real thing that makes this beer cool is the price tag, at $4 (used to be $3) it's great to watch a game and have one or seven. Knowing that you can still afford to actually order food when you go out.</p>

                <p>Voodoo Ranger is a great beer, my problem is I forget how high of an ABV it has and always end up feeling it after 2 or 3, great beer, great flavor, and great value. One of my personal favorite non local craft beers.</p>

                <p>ISU Hazy IPA is a great beer and 1 of 4 officially liscened beers sporting ISU colors or signage, it's a Hazy IPA from Backpocket, which makes great beers all around. I love the can design and the monochromatic scheme.</p>

                <h2>Space Camper Cosmic IPA</h2>
                <p>I like reviewing the non local non small craft beers because I feel stuff like this is a great gateway into your own local beer scene as you can usually get this stuff anywhere and it is still quality stuff. The Space Camper from Boulevard in ole KC MO is no different great flavor, good finish and a nice kick to boot.</p>

                <p>Believe it or not there was a time when I didn't really like beer, when I wanted something to drink this is what I would go for, it's a great way to change things up, but it can also give you gut rot if you drink too many. Overall great malt beverages.</p>

                <p>This beer was a red ale made by Guinness according to the menu at Dublin Bay in Ames. This beer was delicious, it wasn't too heavy, it wasn't too bitter, and it didn't make me feel bogged down. My only gripe is that there wasn't much flavor with it, but it was a good sipping beer.</p>

                <p>Raspberry Night Shift was fantastic. Twisted Vine is one of my favorite breweries in the state. And this very well may be one of my favorite beers from said brewery. I had this at the Ames Jethros. One of the first times I've seen TVBs beers out in the wild. A welcome surprise for sure.</p>

                <p>All Day IPA is a good beer. Not my favorite IPA ever but I am happy to see it in most gas stations and grocery stores throughout the state of Iowa. It's a solid choice that is fairly priced, and easy to drink. It's a staple to find in coolers everywhere during a summer party and I will definitely be stocking up for my next cookout.</p>

                <p>The Confluence Conifer Ginelly Gin Barrel Aged Saison is a mouthful to say. It was a solid beer that REALLY had that Gin taste, the beer was brewed in gin barrels after all. It was on $5 special at Mucky Duck Pub Monday night. So that's really all I have to say about it.</p>

                <h2>Fuller Griffin ESB</h2>
                <p>Fuller Griffin ESB is a pale ale. And a bit more Extra, or Special, or Bitter if you will. It was a solid pale ale at a good price. Lower ABV so you can sip on this bad boy all day. A real Hooligans beer. IDK I've never been to the UK.</p>

                <p>Spotted Cow is a great beer. It's only sold in Wisconsin, which makes it somewhat of a hot commodity when you live outside that state like I do. But I got this beer for helping design a logo for a business in Wisconsin. See there's the connection. It's a great beer that lives up to it's reputation.</p>

                <p>Much like the original halo game fuel from 2007 game fuel always launches in pairs, the first one is always the citrus cherry, and the second one is usually a different flavor, back in 2007 it was Halo 3 and World of Warcraft. This time around the other flavor is Diablo IV Mystic Punch. It's a tropical punch flavor, if you like that, you'll like it, if not you wont. Works great as a mixer.</p>

                <p>Tropical punch flavored stuff kicks ass and this does too. No notes really, other than it tastes like a tropical fruit punch Mountain Dew has done Baja Blast variants a few years ago, but this one is the best by far IMO.</p>
