                <h2>Confluence Gold Ale</h2>
                <p>This beer was easy drinking with a lot going on, inoffensive, but flavorful enough to entice anyone on the beer drinking spectrum.</p>

                <p>Mucky Duck is a British Pub in Ames IA, it's a really good place for anyone to experience good british food and drink. This beer was no different</p>

                <h2>Firetrucker Beer</h2>
                <p>Firetrucker Brewery is located in Ankeny IA, it's one of my favorites and their can design is incredible. Their tagline is "Beer is art" and it's easy to see why with this Brigade Ale I am drinking here.</p>

                <h2>Jethros BBQ 32oz Jar</h2>
                <p>Jethros is a local Iowa BBQ joint, thet have arguably the best happy hour deals in the area, I am able to get this bad boy for only $7.50. This time I went with DSM IPA, my favorite beer from Confluence Brewing.</p>

                <h2>Whiskey River Ankeny</h2>
                <p>Once in a Blue Moon I go to a regular sports bar, and by once in a blue moon I mean about once a week or so, which is about as frequently as I drink Blue Moon, pictured here.</p>

                <h2>Hot Springs Brewing She Don't Use Jelly</h2>
                <p>A buddy of mine went on a trip to the Hot Springs area of Arkansas and picked me up this bad boy. It was delicious and I loved the branding, friends like this 10/10 beer like this? Check the score.</p>

                <h2>Goose Island Wild Herd</h2>
                <p>Buffalo Wild Wings or as I and almost every other jabroni likes to call it B dubs, has a special beer brewed by Goose Island in Chicago, IL. It's pretty solid stuff, just a regular Kolsch but the real thing that makes this beer cool is the price tag, at $4 (used to be $3) it's great to watch a game and have one or seven. Knowing that you can still afford to actually order food when you go out.</p>

                <h2>Voodoo Ranger IPA</h2>
                <p>Voodoo Ranger is a great beer, my problem is I forget how high of an ABV it has and always end up feeling it after 2 or 3, great beer, great flavor, and great value. One of my personal favorite non local craft beers.</p>

                <h2>Iowa State Hazy IPA</h2>
                <p>ISU Hazy IPA is a great beer and 1 of 4 officially liscened beers sporting ISU colors or signage, it's a Hazy IPA from Backpocket, which makes great beers all around. I love the can design and the monochromatic scheme.</p>

                <h2>Space Camper Cosmic IPA</h2>
                <p>I like reviewing the non local non small craft beers because I feel stuff like this is a great gateway into your own local beer scene as you can usually get this stuff anywhere and it is still quality stuff. The Space Camper from Boulevard in ole KC MO is no different great flavor, good finish and a nice kick to boot.</p>

                <h2>Henry's Hard Soda Orange</h2>
                <p>Believe it or not there was a time when I didn't really like beer, when I wanted something to drink this is what I would go for, it's a great way to change things up, but it can also give you gut rot if you drink too many. Overall great malt beverages.</p>
